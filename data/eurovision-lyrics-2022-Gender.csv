My loneliness knocked on my silent door again
When I had forgotten the path to darkness
We have lost the yesterdays, longing for tomorrows
Cry, my heart cry, 'cause this is the final storm
It will be a waste for us, for our love
Don't draw us to sorrow in one breath
If my captivity to you is the only thing that you have left me
Cry my heart, there is a lot of time for the light
Why should our hands
Part our loving eyes?
Didn't our hearts stop beating, when we were apart?
You can't forget even if years pass by
Even if our hair begins to turn grey
No one can make us forget each other

You were standing in the shadows
Looking quite impossible, I lost my mind and popsicle

A radio was singing
Something blue in perfect tune
Half a look over your shoulder
I couldn’t keep from staring back at you

My heart goes boom when I see you, baby
Don’t you tell me maybe, it can never be too soon
My heart goes boom, put your arms around me
Say you’re glad you found me, take me spinning round the moon
My heart goes boom

Summer, Saturday, and sunset
You said hello and I said hi, and something lit the evening sky
You came out of the shadows
With a teasing twinkle in your eye and took my senses for a ride

A radio was playing
Something slow in perfect tune
Half a smile as you sat down
I couldn’t seem to keep my eyes off you

My heart goes boom when I see you, baby
Don’t you tell me maybe, it can never be too soon
My heart goes boom, put your arms around me
Say you’re glad you found me, take me spinning round the moon

Even though love, I think, can't be said
But since we must talk, listen to me But all I have is my soul
To tell you about myself
Oh, only my soul
My soul and my voice
Flames so fragile
On my fingertips
Ridiculous weapons
To tell you about myself Even though you say I'm a part of you
That our story will follow us step by step
I know very well that love has its own laws
If we must save it, listen to me But all I have is my soul
To tell you about myself
Oh, only my soul
My soul and my voice
And my body which goes up in flames
Upon hearing your voice
I am only a woman
Who silently loves you But let God damn me
If I forget my way
Let life condemn you
If you're not my law anymore
And if this flame which burns for you
Goes out
All I have is my soul
To tell you about myself
All I have is my soul

On the long endless roads, in the rain, in my tears

What's left except your sorrow
Please look behind to see what you've left
While my arms are waiting for you, my love is on the roads
It is going mad
Ah, this heart of mine beats always with the pain you brought to me
The one that carries you in it like crazy
So far away, so far apart, lonely am I, my love, tonight
Longing for all I left behind, precious moments I no longer find
Love has gone, memories - they fade away
Nothing more left for me but only to say
I still love you, please come back, my lonely heart
Keeps calling you back, once again

I met so many kinds of pretty girls
All of them like precious stones
Sparkling on their own

I found them fiery, tender, bright and sweet
In Rome and Paris, Lisbon and Madrid
But one girl remains for me
Still a real mystery
I've been thinkin' about you

Northern girl, Lady Ice - how can I melt you, baby?
Northern girl, never cries - tough like a pearl
Northern girl, frosty eyes, I wanna melt you, baby

We drink the sunset like ruby wine
But still you keep your head and hold the line
Even when you look aside
I admire your pride

We stand together closely, skin to skin
You look forbidding as the Snow Queen
But I hear your secret call
'Cause your fortress has no walls
I'm still thinkin' about you

[Estrofa 1]
Mar en calma, en un atardecer
Y todo vuelve a ser como era entonces
Juego con la arena entre mis pies
Dibujando sin querer tu nombre

[Pre-estribillo 1]
Cuántas veces te llamé en la noche
Cuántas veces te busqué
Por mis recuerdos yo vuelvo y no pierdo la fe

[Estribillo]
Dime qué es lo que puedo hacer
Cómo te puedo tener
En mi vida
Vamos a olvidar el ayer y a comenzar otra vez
Sin mentiras
Dime qué es lo que puedo hacer
Cómo te puedo tener
En mi vida

[Estrofa 2]
Me han contado que tú estás igual
Y que te sientes mal, como yo
No permitas que el orgullo sea
Quien decida por los dos

[Pre-estribillo 2]
Porque tú sabes que te quiero
Y todo lo que dije no es verdad
Deja tus miedos, podemos si quieres volverlo a intentar

[Estribillo]
Dime qué es lo que puedo hacer
Cómo te puedo tener
En mi vida
Vamos a olvidar el ayer y a comenzar otra vez
Sin mentiras
Dime qué es lo que puedo hacer
Cómo te puedo tener
En mi vida

[Puente]
Que tú y yo sabemos
Que no podemos seguir así
Vuelve junto a mí

[Estribillo]
Dime qué es lo que puedo hacer
Cómo te puedo tener
En mi vida
Vamos a olvidar el ayer y a comenzar otra vez
Sin mentiras
Dime qué es lo que puedo hacer
Cómo te puedo tener

Dime, dímelo","A calm sea in the afternoon
 And everything will be as it was before
 I play with the sand between my feet
 Unresistingly I draw your name How many times did I call you in the night?
 How many times did I look for you?
 I return for my memories
 And I don’t lose faith Tell me what it is that I can do
 How I can keep you in my life
 Let’s forget yesterday
 And start again, without lies Tell me what it is that I can do
 How I can keep you in my life Someone told me that you’re the same
 And that you felt bad, like me
 Don’t let it be pride
 That decides for us two Because you know that I love you
 And everything that I told you isn’t true
 Leave your fears, we can
 If you want to try again Tell me what it is that I can do
 How I can keep you in my life
 Let’s forget yesterday
 And start again, without lies Tell me what it is that I can do
 How I can keep you in my life You and I know
 That we can’t live like this

What the rest of the world thinks doesn't matter

In every thing that happens to me
I feel his presence looking at me
I look in every corner
I search in every drawer
Messing up everything until I find my soul
And I surrender to him
And I don't know what to do

I don't want to go out
I don't want to eat
I don't want to live another adventure
I get hot with your body
I feed myself with your kisses
Because you are my only madness
And I don't know what to do
I believe
That it is witchcraft
There's no cure for my soul
I only desire your warm body
And you look like a burning fire
That penetrates me all, all
And I become the target of your witchcraft

""What did you learn at school today?""
That's what the teachers used to say
But they don't know
Don't understand, do they?
Why do they always give advice
Saying ""Just be nice, always think twice""
When it's been a long time since they had a teenage life

Don't understand, do they?
Why do they always give advice
Saying ""Just be nice, always think twice""
When it's been a long time since they had a teenage life

Dwelling on the past, from back when I was young
Thinking of my school days and trying to write this song
Classroom schemes and dreams
Man they couldn't save me
Cos my days were numbered when I signed down on Avy
Teenage kicks running out what could we do
I still show respect to my boys who made it through
And getting told off Mr T how my life would be
Then giving him a signal
So everyone could see
Sunshine and shade
Those girls I'd serenade
Thinking of those sixth form chicks that misbehave
Hoping that those days would go on and on forever
Every day something new
Just friends running together
But suddenly school ends
Your teenage life's gone
All your mates are growing up now
They're moving on
And now I'm looking back
I'll tell you what I know
Do you listen to your teacher?
No I don't think so

""What did you learn at school today?""
That's what the teachers used to say
But they don't know
Don't understand
Do they?
Why do they always give advice
Saying ""Just be nice, always think twice""
When it's been a long since they had a teenage life

Now if you treat the kids fine, together they will shine
Ooh ooh ooh shine
And if you give the kids time, they won't do the crime
Won't do the crime

Now my bad old ways
Were during my school days
Messing on those grade A's
My life is just a haze
I'm going through the struggle
Five ten and kicking back
So I could lock my flow
Lace it up now on the track
Oh yeh I felt the pain
Whilst chasing all the fame
I'm being told I'm nothing
Just a player in the game
But now I walk tall
Stand proud for you to see
I'm driving these fast cars
It's five stars for me

""What did you learn at school today?""

Schon in der Schule die Jungs ha'm gelacht
Doch mir hat's überhaupt nichts ausgemacht
Sie war so süß und ihre Beine so lang
Bin fast ein Jahr in ihren Ballettkurs gegangen

Als ich erfuhr, dass sie auf Umweltschutz steht
Hab ich ""nein danke"" auf mein' Parka genäht
Das hat sie damals alles nicht int'ressiert
Doch seitdem weiß ich wer die Welt regiert

[Chorus]
Wie sie geh'n und steh'n
Wie sie dich anseh'n
Und schon öffnen sich Tasche und Herz
Und dann kaufst du 'n Ring und 'n Nerz

Ein lasziver Blick
Und schon ändert sich deine Politik
Kein Boss und kein Actionheld
Kein Staat und kein Mafiageld
Frauen regiern die Welt

[Verse 2]
Alle Register von kokett bis naiv
Sie ha'm als Baby schon den Vater im Griff
Sie geben alles wenn sie irgendwas wollen
Und du beißt auf Granit wenn sie schmollen

Du machst dich lächerlich und lässt dich verhau'n
Damit die Mädels einmal nur rüberschauen
Sie pushen Beckham und stürtzten Clinton
Ohne dafür 'ne Partei zu gründen

[Chorus] (x2)
Wie sie geh'n und steh'n
Wie sie dich anseh'n

But I really didn't care
She was so cute, her legs were so long
I went to her ballet class for almost a year When I found out she was into the environment
I stitched ''No, thanks'' onto my parka
She didn't care about that back then
But since then I know who rules the world The way the walk and stand
The way they look at you
And your wallet and heart start to open up
And you buy a ring and a mink coat One seductive glance
And your political views start to change
It's not the boss or the action heroes
It's not the state or the mafia money
Women rule the world All the stops, from coquettish to naive
Even as babies, they had a hold on their fathers
They give everything when there's something they want
And you bang your head against a brick wall when they're sulking You make a fool of yourself
And let yourself get beaten up
Just so the girls would look over just once
They can push Beckham
And overthrow Clinton
Without even having to form a party The way the walk and stand
The way they look at you

Illuminated by a cold sun,
And the memories have faded, almost all of them

That all colours exist only with this rhythm
And night and day are just some verse's trail
And it will disappear when our songs fade out. Play that romance tonight
Quietly, softly that it makes me ill
Tha sadness when a nightingale dies
When soul separates from the body Play that romance tonight
But slowly, so everyone can hear it
May the guitars play again

Don't just go with the flow

And the firefly comes to you, sits on your finger
It shatters and shakes, but she wants you to go with her now
Follow her out there

The firefly, spreading her wings open wide
Thinks the sky will come crashing down, fall to her side
She's afraid, but her fear's only fair

So fly with the firefly, fly side by side

Don't look down, you're over the edge

Wanna be in the dream and have some fun
If you wanna be on the hook
Then simply take a look

And you looked just like an angel
You looked up and saw the sky
Saw the birds and wondered why
They could fly away so high

In the morning I would wake
And my heart just couldn't wait
To play in your backyard
In the evening I would go
Telling you I love you so
And I couldn't wait to see you again

It's you and me and everybody out there
And I can see that everybody knows
About you and me, but I don't really care for it
I can see that everybody knows about us

We grew up knowing love
Thanking God up above
That we could be together forever
We would never say goodbye
Cause we promised, you and I
But our love couldn't handle time

And I see you walking by my house
And wonder why we don't play around no more
Such a shame we have no time
They were wrong and we were right
I still love you and in my mind

About you and me, but I don't really care for it

Thinking 'bout it all and how it ends sometimes

while a woman shakes that piece of meat,
the heat is on 200 like in a microwave,
our brains'll explode, a stroboscope makes flashes. The beat is sick, it's banging on my head,
my wallet is empty, give me a drink,
a grill, a clove, a parsley, a fish,
give me everything to get fed. And take me somewhere to clear my head,
somewhere where the music is playing loud,
so that it doesn't stop, that it just keeps grooving,
that it lasts all night and that everyone are a tuna. The pressure is being suffered, I'm coping with struggle,
take me somewhere so that I don't explode,
I'm opening a can, life is a miracle,
let's go to the dance, where should we go else ? Ref.

Nearly took my feet off the ground

Maybe this was kismet now
And my body started moving

Something happened when I was dancing
I could feel that powerful beat
Taking me to new dimensions
Waking up the devil in me

That flies towards warmer countries
When there is winter in the soul.

Maybe will crash.

Mjesto sretan da budem bir’o sam tugu u inat

Njenim očima uklet više se ne znam nasmijat

Pa me mami toplinama nakon čaše-dv’je vina
Al’ ona nije ta što će mi sutra roditi sina
Opet nijedna ne zna me tako magično dirat
Opet tragično pijan jer đavo ne da mi mira

Even the gray walls I’ve got no one to come back to
I only trust you
I’ll pay all my dues
I swear by love Love is an enchanted circle
Everyone gets their own turn
Everyone pays their due
Love is all we’ve got
Everyone chooses their own sin
We forgive each other ... we forgive I need your body so much
When I close my eyes
The heart swore by you
How can I forgive you? I’ve got no one to come back to
I only trust you
I’ll pay all my dues
I swear by love Instead of being a captain, I chose to be a pirate
Instead of being happy, I chose to be sad in spite
My story’s a roulette — I invest, but don’t know how to cash out
Cursed by her eyes, I don’t know how to smile anymore
And she lures me with her curves after a glass or two of wine
But she ain’t the one who’s gonna give me a son tomorrow
Then again, no other woman knows how to touch me in such a magical way
I’m tragically drunk, yet again ‘cause the devil won't leave me alone! Love is an enchanted circle
Everyone gets their own turn
Everyone pays their due
Love is all we’ve got
Everyone chooses their own sin

And grabbed a cigarette out of your bag

Sound of you breathing
Feel of your skin
Brought back some memories

My mind is spinning

Say that I lived just to love you

Sometimes life harms you without even warning you
Sometimes it reminds me of a melody
So lost and frustrated it won't let you see the daylight
Do it for your lover, do it for your lover baby, clap your hands and do it for your lover.
Do it for your lover, do it for your lover baby, clap your hands and do it for your lover,
Do it for your lover, do it for your lover,
Do it for those you ever care and love
And love
And love
Hold my hand, don't close that door
Let the pain and sorrow just go away
Then shout, get out there and fly
And you'll see it's worth doing it for your loved ones
So
Do it for your lover, do it for your lover baby, clap your hands and do it for your lover.
Do it for your lover, do it for your lover baby, clap your hands and do it for your lover,

Ky mall që të djeg nuk njeh kufi as largësi

Asgjë në këtë botë nuk mund ta shprehë dot ndjesinë

where the divine dreams heal every wound.
To see her portrait
Moments pass by
seconds don`t forgive
hours go but they can`t stop the feeling, no As by magic, the moon gazes our stares
it brings me your vision. Undried tear, enlighten this night
resound today from the silent soul.
Just a moment the pain stops me
This undried tear will drain one day
from the fiery kisses it dreamed
at that moment the pain will stop. Sweet this life, but it knows no boundaries
sometimes it caresses us, sometimes it separates us

He lived where every road ended
One thousand and one years aren’t enough for a life, for a life I can hear him, his heart on the strings
I can see him, bearing the passing time on my face
I’m proud to confess his faith
Of a thousand and one songs this is the one that I hum Old days, beautiful days
I love his memory
He calls me and I run to him
That was a lovely way to play Old songs summon him
I still feel the sun's light
I can still hear the drone of the wind
I can still hear him in the voice of the wind With a song he drove my sadness far away
All I can give him is that I belong to him
And I can say to my son with pride
He's my father, and here's my home Old days, beautiful days
I love his memory
He calls me and I run to him
That was a lovely way to play Old songs summon him

I'm tired, tired of always losing
I tried to stop your fire
Turns out that I couldn’t
I'm tired, tired of competing
I tried to hold you under
But honey, you kept breathing

When you said you wanted the world
I said you couldn't too
You were walking right beside me
But I left no room for you
Calling you my enemy, but my enemy’s right here
It was my mistake to try and break
That power that I feared

Here I am in the noise and in the silence
Look at me, or at least what's left of it
Look at me, before I hate myself
What to tell you that another's lips won't tell you

Here I am even if stripped naked it's over

But do without you, I don't know how
Love me as we love a friend who is gone forever

What could it be?
I think it‘s all about the deep hydration
They say our skin and hair show it all
For example –
Deep under-eye circles could signal liver troubles
The pesky spots around the lips point to an enlarged spleen
That‘s not a good spleen, not a very pretty spleen
And the artist ought to be healthy:
To be healthy, to be healthy, to be healthy,
To be, to be, to be
To be healthy, to be healthy, to be healthy,
To be, to be, to be
How lucky, the existence of the autonomic nervous system
No need to control the heart beats
The heart beats
The heart beats, alone
A summer‘s day, the colours bright, the skirts of mine
On my body
My dog and I
We walk
Just the two of us, counting steps
The skirt steps
around my leg
We are walking
And that is all
And it does not have to get better! the heart beats by itself!
I surrender my trust, let it beat by itself!
I surrender my trust, let it beat, let me breathe!
God grant us health, grant us, grant us health!
God grant us health, since there‘s no
Medical insurance for me
Now how will they follow me?
All in the name of health
How will they care for me?
All in the name of health
The artist is invisible
All in the name of health
You can‘t see me, it‘s magical

With each heartbeat, blood flows slower

The scent of you wakes me up again every morning
But from now on I‘ll go to disco club on my own
And watch the same movie, without playing my part in it
